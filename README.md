# 👨🏾‍💻 Andre Thomas — CV App (AI‑enabled)

## 🌟 Overview

This is my interactive CV built with modern web technologies. It showcases my skills, experience, education, and selected projects in a sleek, engaging format. The app also includes an **AI chatbot** 🤖 that assumes my professional persona and answers questions a recruiter or hiring manager might ask (e.g., background, projects, responsibilities, tools, and strengths).
